**Lab 14_0: Monitoring Database Performance**

### Objectives:
- Understand the various tools available for monitoring database performance, including EM Express, Cloud Control, and Performance Views.
- Learn how to use Performance Views via SQL Developer or SQL*Plus to monitor key metrics in an Oracle Database.
- Identify critical areas of performance monitoring and understand their importance in maintaining a healthy database environment.

### Use Case:
In a production environment, maintaining optimal database performance is crucial. Various tools and views provide insight into the database's operational status, allowing DBAs to proactively address potential issues before they impact the system's overall performance. This lab focuses on using SQL Developer or SQL*Plus to monitor performance using Performance Views, which are essential in environments where graphical tools might not be available or preferred.

### Steps:

#### 1. **Monitoring Instance and Database Statistics**
   - **Step**: Query the `V$DATABASE`, `V$INSTANCE`, and `V$SYSSTAT` views to gather general information about the database instance and its performance statistics.
   - **Commands**:
     ```sql
     SELECT name, open_mode FROM v$database;
     SELECT instance_name, status FROM v$instance;
     SELECT name, value FROM v$sysstat WHERE name IN ('DB time', 'DB CPU', 'DB block changes');
     ```
   - **Explanation**:
     - **V$DATABASE**: Provides information about the database, such as its name and open mode.
     - **V$INSTANCE**: Displays the instance status, indicating whether the database is open and operational.
     - **V$SYSSTAT**: Contains a wide array of statistics that help monitor database performance, such as CPU usage, time spent on database operations, and block changes.
   - **Importance**: These views help you understand the overall health and activity of the database, essential for identifying high-level performance issues.

#### 2. **Monitoring Disk I/O Performance**
   - **Step**: Use the `V$FILESTAT`, `V$TEMPFILE`, and `V$SEGMENT_STATISTICS` views to monitor disk performance and identify any potential bottlenecks.
   - **Commands**:
     ```sql
     SELECT file_name, phyrds, phywrts FROM v$datafile;
     SELECT file_name, tablespace_name, bytes FROM v$tempfile;
     SELECT object_name, tablespace_name, reads, writes FROM v$segment_statistics;
     ```
   - **Explanation**:
     - **V$FILESTAT**: Provides statistics on physical reads and writes for each datafile, which helps identify I/O hotspots.
     - **V$TEMPFILE**: Shows information about temporary files, which are often used for sorting and other operations requiring temporary storage.
     - **V$SEGMENT_STATISTICS**: Helps identify which segments (e.g., tables, indexes) are generating the most I/O activity.
   - **Importance**: Monitoring disk I/O is critical for ensuring that the database does not experience slowdowns due to inefficient disk usage or contention for disk resources.

#### 3. **Monitoring Memory Usage**
   - **Step**: Query the `V$SGAINFO`, `V$BUFFER_POOL_STATISTICS`, and `V$LIBRARYCACHE` views to monitor memory utilization and efficiency.
   - **Commands**:
     ```sql
     SELECT name, value FROM v$sgainfo WHERE name IN ('Buffer Cache Size', 'Shared Pool Size', 'Large Pool Size');
     SELECT pool, name, bytes FROM v$buffer_pool_statistics;
     SELECT namespace, gets, gethits, pins, pinhits FROM v$librarycache;
     ```
   - **Explanation**:
     - **V$SGAINFO**: Provides information about the different components of the System Global Area (SGA), such as the buffer cache and shared pool sizes.
     - **V$BUFFER_POOL_STATISTICS**: Displays statistics on the buffer pools, which are critical for managing how data blocks are cached in memory.
     - **V$LIBRARYCACHE**: Monitors the performance of the library cache, which stores parsed SQL and PL/SQL code, helping to reduce parsing overhead.
   - **Importance**: Efficient memory management is crucial for maintaining database performance, as it impacts everything from query execution speed to the ability to handle multiple concurrent users.

#### 4. **Monitoring Session Activity**
   - **Step**: Use the `V$SESSION`, `V$SESSION_EVENT`, and `V$SESSION_WAIT` views to monitor active sessions and their current activities.
   - **Commands**:
     ```sql
     SELECT sid, username, status FROM v$session WHERE status = 'ACTIVE';
     SELECT event, total_waits, time_waited FROM v$session_event WHERE sid = &sid;
     SELECT event, wait_time, state FROM v$session_wait WHERE sid = &sid;
     ```
   - **Explanation**:
     - **V$SESSION**: Provides details about current database sessions, including the session ID, user, and status.
     - **V$SESSION_EVENT**: Shows the wait events that a session has encountered, which can indicate potential performance bottlenecks.
     - **V$SESSION_WAIT**: Displays real-time wait information for sessions, useful for diagnosing performance issues.
   - **Importance**: Monitoring sessions helps identify problematic queries or processes that may be consuming excessive resources, allowing for timely intervention.

#### 5. **Monitoring Contention**
   - **Step**: Check the `V$LOCK`, `V$LATCH`, and `V$UNDOSTAT` views to identify and resolve contention issues.
   - **Commands**:
     ```sql
     SELECT * FROM v$lock WHERE block = 1;
     SELECT name, gets, misses, sleeps FROM v$latch;
     ```
   - **Explanation**:
     - **V$LOCK**: Displays information about locks held on database objects, helping identify blocked sessions.
     - **V$LATCH**: Provides statistics on latch activity, which is critical for ensuring that concurrent access to shared resources is efficiently managed.
     - **V$UNDOSTAT**: Shows statistics related to undo management, important for managing rollback and read consistency in the database.
   - **Importance**: Monitoring contention is crucial to avoid performance degradation due to resource conflicts, ensuring smooth database operation.
