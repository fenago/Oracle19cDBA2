### Lab_19_0: Backup and Recovery

#### Objectives:
- Explore your Oracle environment using RMAN.
- Understand the limitations of the SYSBACKUP role in Oracle Database.
- Configure essential recovery settings, including the Fast Recovery Area (FRA), multiplexing of control files and redo logs, and ARCHIVELOG mode.
- Configure your database for maximum recoverability.

#### Use Case:
In a real-world scenario, databases can experience failures due to hardware issues, human error, or other unforeseen events. As a DBA, you need to ensure that the database can be recovered quickly with minimal data loss. This lab will equip you with the skills needed to configure and manage Oracle's recovery options, ensuring your database is prepared for any failure.

#### Environment:
- **Database**: CDBLAB
- **PDBs**: PDBLAB1, PDBLAB2

#### Steps:

---

### Part 1: Setting Up the HR Schema

Before proceeding with the backup and recovery tasks, ensure that the HR schema exists in PDBLAB1.

1. **Create the HR Schema in PDBLAB1**:
   ```sql
   CONNECT sys@PDBLAB1 AS SYSDBA;
   
   -- Create HR user
   CREATE USER hr IDENTIFIED BY hr_password;
   GRANT CONNECT, RESOURCE TO hr;
   
   -- Create example tables in HR schema
   CONNECT hr/hr_password@PDBLAB1;

   CREATE TABLE employees (
       employee_id NUMBER(6),
       first_name VARCHAR2(20),
       last_name VARCHAR2(25),
       email VARCHAR2(25),
       hire_date DATE,
       job_id VARCHAR2(10),
       salary NUMBER(8,2),
       manager_id NUMBER(6),
       department_id NUMBER(4),
       PRIMARY KEY (employee_id)
   );

   INSERT INTO employees VALUES (100, 'Steven', 'King', 'SKING', SYSDATE, 'AD_PRES', 24000, NULL, 90);
   INSERT INTO employees VALUES (101, 'Neena', 'Kochhar', 'NKOCHHAR', SYSDATE, 'AD_VP', 17000, 100, 90);
   INSERT INTO employees VALUES (102, 'Lex', 'De Haan', 'LDEHAAN', SYSDATE, 'AD_VP', 17000, 100, 90);
   COMMIT;
   ```

2. **Verify HR Schema and Data**:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM hr.employees;
   ```

---

### Part 2: Connecting with RMAN

1. **Connect to RMAN**:
   ```shell
   rman target /
   ```
   - **Explanation**: RMAN is Oracle's built-in utility for backup and recovery tasks. Connecting to RMAN allows you to manage backups, recover databases, and perform other related tasks.

2. **Explore RMAN Environment**:
   ```rman
   SHOW ALL;
   ```
   - **Explanation**: This command lists all RMAN configuration settings, giving you an overview of your current backup and recovery configurations.

---

### Part 3: Connect the SYSBACKUP Role to SQL Developer

1. **Create a New User with SYSBACKUP Role**:
   ```sql
   CREATE USER backup_user IDENTIFIED BY backup_password;
   GRANT SYSBACKUP TO backup_user;
   ```
   - **Explanation**: The SYSBACKUP role is used exclusively for backup and recovery tasks. This role restricts the user to these functions and prevents them from performing other administrative tasks.

2. **Connect with SQL Developer Using SYSBACKUP Role**:
   - Open SQL Developer.
   - Create a new connection using the `backup_user` credentials.
   - Choose the SYSBACKUP role from the drop-down options.

3. **Test SYSBACKUP Limitations**:
   - **Attempt to Query a Table**:
     ```sql
     SELECT * FROM hr.employees;
     ```
   - **Expected Outcome**: The user should receive an error message indicating insufficient privileges.

   - **Explanation**: The SYSBACKUP role does not have privileges to perform DML or DDL operations on regular database objects, ensuring that its use is restricted to backup and recovery activities.

---

### Part 4: Configuring the Fast Recovery Area (FRA)

0. Perform the following steps connected to CDBLAB as sysdba

   First, create the following directory:

   ```sql
   mkdir -p /u01/app/oracle/fast_recovery_area
   ```
   Then

   ```sql
   sqlplus sys/fenago@cdblab as sysdba
   ```
  
2. **Set the FRA Location and Size**:

   ```sql
   ALTER SYSTEM SET DB_RECOVERY_FILE_DEST='/u01/app/oracle/fast_recovery_area' SCOPE=BOTH;
   ALTER SYSTEM SET DB_RECOVERY_FILE_DEST_SIZE=20G SCOPE=BOTH;
   ```
   - **Explanation**: The FRA is a unified storage area for all recovery-related files, such as backups, archived redo logs, and control file copies. Proper configuration ensures that there is sufficient space for recovery operations.

---

### Part 5: Multiplexing Control Files

 
1. **View Current Control File Settings**:
   ```sql
   SHOW PARAMETER control_files;
   ```

2. **Add an Additional Control File**:
   ```sql
   ALTER SYSTEM SET control_files='/u01/app/oracle/oradata/CDBLAB/control01.ctl', '/u01/app/oracle/oradata/CDBLAB/control02.ctl' SCOPE=SPFILE;
   SHUTDOWN IMMEDIATE;
   STARTUP;
   ```
   - **Explanation**: Multiplexing control files by maintaining multiple copies ensures that the database remains operational even if one control file is lost or corrupted.

---

### Part 6: Multiplexing Redo Log Files

1. **View Current Redo Log Files**:
   ```sql
   SELECT GROUP#, MEMBER FROM V$LOGFILE;
   ```

2. **Add Additional Members to Each Redo Log Group**:
   ```sql
   ALTER DATABASE ADD LOGFILE MEMBER '/u01/app/oracle/oradata/CDBLAB/redo01b.log' TO GROUP 1;
   ALTER DATABASE ADD LOGFILE MEMBER '/u01/app/oracle/oradata/CDBLAB/redo02b.log' TO GROUP 2;
   ALTER DATABASE ADD LOGFILE MEMBER '/u01/app/oracle/oradata/CDBLAB/redo03b.log' TO GROUP 3;
   ```
   - **Explanation**: Multiplexing redo log files helps prevent data loss due to redo log file corruption by maintaining multiple copies of each redo log.

---

### Part 7: Configuring ARCHIVELOG Mode

1. **Check the Current ARCHIVELOG Mode**:
   ```rman
   ARCHIVE LOG LIST;
   ```

2. **Enable ARCHIVELOG Mode**:
   ```sql
   SHUTDOWN IMMEDIATE;
   STARTUP MOUNT;
   ALTER DATABASE ARCHIVELOG;
   ALTER DATABASE OPEN;
   ```

3. **Set Archive Log Destination**:
   ```sql
   ALTER SYSTEM SET log_archive_dest_1='LOCATION=/u01/app/oracle/archivelog';
   ```
   - **Explanation**: ARCHIVELOG mode is essential for complete database recovery, allowing the capture of all transactions that have occurred. This ensures that the database can be fully recovered from a backup, including all committed transactions.

---

### Part 8: Scheduling Regular Backups

0) connect to rman (First line)

rman target /

1. **Schedule Regular RMAN Backups**:
   ```rman
   RUN {
     BACKUP DATABASE PLUS ARCHIVELOG;
     DELETE OBSOLETE;
   }
   ```
   - **Explanation**: Regular backups ensure that you have recent data copies available for recovery. Including the `ARCHIVELOG` ensures that the backup contains all committed transactions.

---
